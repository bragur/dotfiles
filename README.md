# bragur's Dotfiles

## Introduction

This repository contains dotfiles for various applications and services. The configuration files are ready to be symlinked via `stow` and may be used like the following code snippet, for example when initializing zshâ€™s config:

```sh
$ stow zsh
```

Feel free to use my config as you will, however they may be opinionated in various ways. For instance, Neovim is set up to accommodate mostly for writing code in ReScript and JS but there may be some nice reusable bits in between.
